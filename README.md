## 📘 Folder Breakdown

### 🔹 `Jupiter files/`  
💡 A set of useful mini-scripts and notebooks that demonstrate Python basics and automation.

- 📄 `BMI.ipynb` – Calculates Body Mass Index.
- 📄 `Automatic_file_sorter.ipynb` – Organizes files into folders by file type.
- 📄 `GroupBy.ipynb`, `Indexing.ipynb`, `filtering.ipynb` – Hands-on with pandas indexing, grouping, and filtering.
- 📄 `MJC.ipynb` – Miscellaneous Jupyter cells for experiments.

### 🔹 `Pandas/`  
📊 Datasets and practice scripts focused on mastering **Pandas** for data analysis:

- 🧾 `Ice Cream Ratings.csv`, `Flavors.csv` – Fun food-related datasets.
- 🌍 `countries of the world.csv` & `.txt`, `world_population.csv` – Population and country insights.
- 🧙‍♂️ `LOTR.csv`, `LOTR 2.csv` – Explore Lord of the Rings data.
- 📞 `Customer Call List.xlsx`, `json_sample.json` – Real-world data formats for cleaning and transformation tasks.

### 🔹 `Web Scraping p1/`  
🌐 Projects demonstrating how to extract data from the web using `pandas.read_html()` and other tools.

- 🕸️ `webscraping.ipynb` – Scrapes table data directly from a website using Pandas functions like `read_html()` and processes it for analysis.
- 📁 `customer.csv` – The resulting structured data extracted from the webpage.
