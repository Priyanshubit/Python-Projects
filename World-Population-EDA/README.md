## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns  
✔ Removed null values and formatting issues  
✔ Cleaned phone numbers and standardized formats  
✔ Split and formatted address columns (if present)  
✔ Renamed and arranged columns for consistency

## 📊 Problem Statement:

With rapid changes in global demographics, policymakers, researchers, and businesses need clear insights into how population trends evolve across 
countries and continents. However, raw population data is often unstructured, difficult to interpret, and lacks interactive visualization for exploration.
This project aims to solve this by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing worldwide population data (1970–2022) to identify trends, correlations, outliers,
and continental growth patterns using an interactive dashboard built with Python and Streamlit.
