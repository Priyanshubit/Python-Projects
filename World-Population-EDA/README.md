## 🌍 World Population EDA Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Streamlit** to explore world population trends from **1970 to 2022**. This project focuses on cleaning raw population data and performing insightful visual analysis for global understanding.

## 📦 Dataset Used

- Cleaned from: `cleaned_population_data.csv`
- Columns include: Population data from 1970–2022, Continent, Area, Density, Growth Rate, etc.

## 📊 Problem Statement:

With rapid changes in global demographics, policymakers, researchers, and businesses need clear insights into how population trends evolve across 
countries and continents. However, raw population data is often unstructured, difficult to interpret, and lacks interactive visualization for exploration.
This project aims to solve this by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing worldwide population data (1970–2022) to identify trends, correlations, outliers,
and continental growth patterns using an interactive dashboard built with Python and Streamlit.

## ✅ Objectives:
🧼 Clean and standardize raw population data

📊 Visualize key insights like top populated countries and continent growth

🔍 Detect outliers and highlight unusual population patterns

🔗 Explore relationships between census years using correlation

📈 Provide an interactive dashboard for users to explore data visually

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns  
✔ Removed null values and formatting issues  
✔ Cleaned phone numbers and standardized formats  
✔ Split and formatted address columns (if present)  
✔ Renamed and arranged columns for consistency
